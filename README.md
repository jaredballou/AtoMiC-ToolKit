# Python fork of Atomic Toolkit

This is a new instance of the tool, trying to make it much simpler. The long-term plan is to be able to deploy a stack and connect the components via API/credentials via the tool in a repeatable manner.

## New frontend

* Menu and CLI interface
* Allow batch operations

## New config-based backend

* Smallest set of values for apps
* Categorize apps and group alternatives (i.e. "TV Downloader" is a category, "Sick" is an alternative with Sick(Rage|Gear|Beard) apps it)
