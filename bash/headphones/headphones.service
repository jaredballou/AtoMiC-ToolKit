# Headphones - Automatic eBook Downloader
#
# Service Unit file for systemd system manager
#
# INSTALLATION NOTES
#
#    1. Rename this file as you want, ensuring that it ends in .service
#        e.g. 'headphones.service'
#
#    2. Adjust configuration settings as required.  More details in the
#       "CONFIGURATION NOTES" section shown below.
#
#    3. Copy this file into your systemd service unit directory, which is
#       often '/lib/systemd/system'.
#
#    4. Create any files/directories that you specified back in step #2.
#        e.g. '/etc/headphones/headphones.ini'
#             '/home/headphones/.headphones'
#
#    5. Enable boot-time autostart with the following commands:
#        systemctl daemon-reload
#        systemctl enable headphones.service
#
#    6. Start now with the following command:
#        systemctl start headphones.service
#
#   7. If troubleshooting startup-errors, start by checking permissions
#      and ownership on the files/directories that you created in step #4.
#
#
# CONFIGURATION NOTES
#
#     - The example settings in this file assume that:
#        1. You will run headphones as user/group: headphones.headphones
#        2. You will either have headphones installed as a subdirectory
#           under '~headphones', or that you will have a symlink under
#           '~/headphones' pointing to your headphones install dir.
#        3. Your headphones data directory and configuration file will be
#           in separate locations from your headphones install dir, to
#           simplify updates.
#            
#    - Option names (e.g. ExecStart=, Type=) appear to be case-sensitive)
#
#    - Adjust ExecStart= to point to:
#        1. Your headphones executable,
#        2. Your config file (recommended is to put it somewhere in /etc)
#       3. Your datadir (recommended is to NOT put it in your headphones exec dir)
#
#    - Adjust User= and Group= to the user/group you want headphones to run as.
#
#    - WantedBy= specifies which target (i.e. runlevel) to start headphones for.
#        multi-user.target equates to runlevel 3 (multi-user text mode)
#        graphical.target  equates to runlevel 5 (multi-user X11 graphical mode)
